# RPN

Reverse Polish notation calculator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The reason of choosing React is: I've been working on React for last several years. CRA is the simpliest way to start a React project will all instruments I nees, including unit test framework, also it hides dependencies, so, the `git` repository will not be huge.

This project doesn't contain any buttons, only one input. Also I've not set up any CSS preprocessor or postprocessor here.

## How to launch it

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
